### How to increase the value of Shidded Coin?

Tell your friends, share SHID with them, make shidded memes.  Work with crypto jesus John Mcafee, mention Elon Musk a bunch on Twitter.

[Automated Market Makers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) are what determines 
the price of Shidded Coin. Automated market makers are smart contracts that create a liquidity pool of ERC-20 tokens, 
which are automatically traded by an algorithm rather than an order book. This effectively replaces a traditional limit order-book 
with a system where assets can be automatically swapped against the pool's latest price.

Simply put, the more Shidded Coins purchased, the higher the price goes.
