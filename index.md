### How to increase the value of Shidded Coin?

Tell your friends, share SHID with them, make shidded memes.  Work with crypto jesus John Mcafee, mention Elon Musk a bunch on Twitter.

[Automated Market Makers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) determine
the price of Shidded Coin. Automated market makers are smart contracts that create a liquidity pool of ERC-20 tokens, 
which are automatically traded by an algorithm rather than an order book. This effectively replaces a traditional limit order-book 
with a system where assets can be automatically swapped against the pool's latest price.

Simply put, the more Shidded Coins purchased, the higher the price goes.

### How was Shidded Coin created?

Shidded Coin is an ERC-20 token; it is defined in a smart contract within the Ethereum blockchain. Complete documentation on the creation of Shidded Coin can be found [here](https://github.com/shidcoin/SHIDCOIN/blob/main/docs/shid_creation_steps.md).
[Open Zeppelin's ERC-20 token template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) was used to generate the Ethereum smart contract. [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) provides libraries of modular, reusable, secure smart contracts for the Ethereum network, written in Solidity.
